Power BI Dashboards â€“ Sales Forecasting Project

This repository showcases three interactive dashboards built in Power BI using the Kaggle Sales Forecasting dataset
. The aim is to demonstrate how data visualization can transform raw sales data into meaningful business insights.

1. Sales Performance Overview

Focus: Company-wide KPIs and regional performance.

Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold at a glance.

Trends over time: sales and profit patterns, seasonal spikes, and anomalies.

Regional breakdowns: side-by-side views of sales, profit, and quantity across West, East, Central, and South regions.

Key takeaway: West and East lead in sales and profitability, while Central and South show opportunities for growth.

2. Customer Segmentation & Purchasing Behavior

Focus: Understanding customer types and their contribution to business.

Segmentation by Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.

Sales & Profit distribution across segments with pie and bar charts.

Quantity Sold by Segment to highlight purchasing volume.

Key takeaway: Consumer segment dominates sales and profit, while Corporate and Home Office present smaller but steady contributions.

3. Product Category Insights

Focus: Category- and subcategory-level performance.

Sales by Category: Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies.

Profitability breakdown: high profitability in Technology, lower margins in Furniture.

Subcategory performance: Top products (e.g., Phones, Chairs) and laggards identified.

Key takeaway: Technology drives the most profit, while Furniture lags despite decent sales â€” an area for margin optimization.
