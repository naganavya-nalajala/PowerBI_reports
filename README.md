In this exploratory analysis, we delve into the sales data of our superstore, aiming to uncover key insights and potential areas for improvement. The dashboard and analysis are done with Microsoft PowerBI.

1. Performance Against Expected Values
We begin by comparing Total Sales and Total Profit against the company's expected values. This provides an overview of our performance relative to set benchmarks.

2. Category Analysis: Sales vs. Profit

3. Top and Bottom Selling Items
Identifying our top 5 and bottom 5 selling items within sub-categories sheds light on product popularity and areas needing attention.

4. Monthly Sales Trends
Examining monthly sales data helps us pinpoint peak and off-peak periods. We also analyze the margin between total sales and returns: Notably high margin in Q4 (Oct-Dec) suggests a strategic focus on this quarter for increased profitability.

5. Geographic Sales Analysis
Visualizing sales by state using bubbles highlights regional disparities:
California and New York stand out with high sales, potentially due to their larger populations and higher tech consumption.
Low sales states present opportunities for targeted advertising and tailored product offerings.

Furniture Sales ðŸª‘: Despite high sales, profitability is low. Consider product innovation and price adjustments to increase profit margins.
